# ChatGPT Sites and artifacts prompts

Source: `app.asar` of the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app 26.924.20706 (build 11431), SHA-256 `1acbc007c34d2cb5592cd636712b39feb0d0a064002a95e77bb3bbcdadda5dde`.

Messages for ChatGPT Sites (publishing, automations, custom domains) and the context the app adds when a task starts from the Library or a writing block.

ChatGPT's own system prompt is not in the app; the servers add it. The phrase "You are ChatGPT" occurs in none of the app's scripts.

Each entry says whether its text is exact (one literal in the bundle) or assembled (literal pieces joined as the app joins them). Entries with a message id or translator note are formatjs messages: the text shown is the English source (`defaultMessage`), and the app sends the model whatever the user's language translates it to.

## Sites

### Sites handoff

Translator note: First message sent after confirming the Sites checkout-return dialog. The saved HTML file is attached to a new Work task. Keep @Sites literal as the plugin name.

```text

```

### Site automation

Exact text from the bundle. Message id `appgenSettings.customDomains.setupDialog.askChatGptPrompt`.

Translator note: Prefilled prompt for a new Sites thread opened from custom-domain DNS setup. It asks Sites to help finish registration at the user's domain provider, using the in-app browser when useful. {hostname} is the exact custom hostname and {dnsRecords} is a newline-separated list of DNS record type, host name, and value.

```text
Help me register {hostname} as the custom domain for my site by adding these DNS records at my domain provider. Use the in-app browser if needed.

```text
Revise this presentation outline to exactly <…> slides total. Preserve its presentation title, cover-slide choice, topic, key facts, and logical flow.

If a title slide is present, label it "## Slide 1 (Title): <presentation title>", keep it to the title and optional subtitle, and include it in the total. Give each content slide one clear focus and concise dash bullets. Combine closely related ideas when reducing slides; split complex ideas or add meaningful sections when expanding.
